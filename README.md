# Vision
A Project Based On Image processing And Breadth First Search Path Finding Algorithm

This project is based on the instructions given in the following [Problem Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gC5mwmm_vMUPtPOinPhZ4rZZTMcA5sih/view?usp=sharing).

## Installation Guidelines
Along with this repository, it is needed to have the following repository:
* [Vision_Arena](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/Vision-2.0-2020-Arena)

Follow the steps given in these repositories and install the packages required.

You can either run the code directly on visual studio using [Vision.sln](https://github.com/milind-prajapat/Vision/blob/main/Vision.sln) or can run [Solution.py](https://github.com/milind-prajapat/Vision/blob/main/Solution.py).

## Approach
1. The arena was converted into a 2D matrix using image processing techniques where a particular node number denoted each square of the arena.
2. Breadth First Search Path Finding Algorithm was used to determine the shortest path to the destination node.
4. We used the differential drive to run the bot more efficiently

## Project Features
1. Visual representation of the arena and the bot movements were done using **PyBullet**
2. **Image processing** techniques were used to manipulate the data, i.e., shape, colour and aruco marker detection in programmable form
3. **Breadth First Search Path Finding Algorithm** determined the shortest path to reach the destination node.
